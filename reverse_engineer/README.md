### Flashing Open Source Firmware on an LED Controller with a BL602 Chip Using Linux

This tutorial outlines the process of flashing open source firmware on an LED controller equipped with a BL602 chip using a Linux system. You can perform this operation on any device that has a Wi-Fi card.

#### Overview of the Process
The entire process can be summarized in the following steps:
- Connect to the Access Point (AP) created by the LED controller.
- Set up an HTTP server to host the new firmware.
- Send an AT command to the device to specify the server's address and initiate the Over-The-Air (OTA) update process.

#### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Connecting to the AP using `wpa_supplicant`**:
    - Use the `wpa_supplicant.conf.template` template to generate a configuration file named `wpa_supplicantLED.conf`.
    - Run `wpa_supplicant` with the following command:
      ```bash
      wpa_supplicant -i wlan0 -c wpa_supplicantLED.conf
      ```
    - After a short while, you should see log entries from `wpa_supplicant` indicating a successful connection:
      ```
      wlan0: Associated with b4:e8:42:29:07:16
      wlan0: CTRL-EVENT-CONNECTED - Connection to b4:e8:42:29:07:16 completed [id=0 id_str=]
      wlan0: CTRL-EVENT-SUBNET-STATUS-UPDATE status=0
      ```
